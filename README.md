# Application-Reporting-Automation
A serverless application to deliver application reports in the form of Jira Confluence Webpages. Utilizes Python, NodeJS, HTML, and CSS. The final version of this product lives in AWS Lambda; however, due to security reasons, this version of the code cannot be released to the public. I have modified the project to run on EC2 containers, and utilize the Shell Scripting languge instead.

Many of the credentials needed to run this project have been redacted; however, you may still view my code. Full the for documentation for this project, please view the dated readme in the root of the repo.
